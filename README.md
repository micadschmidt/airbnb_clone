About:
The goal of this project was to develop a replica of Airbnb model within 5 days. 🏠The user can visit the landing and index (flats offers) of the website but needs to sign in/sign up to access the individual info of every flat, reserve, cancel, see other offers on the map, etc.
👨🏼‍💻We have 2 types of user: host and common user with different validations and routes inside de website.
1. The common user that reserved a flat can cancel the reservation, modified it or leave a rating/comment about their stay also.
2. The host user can also make reservations, cancel, leave ratings but also post new offers about flats available with its necessary descriptions (price, location, numbers of guests, photos).
